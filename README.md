# A_A_B_test
The research was done for a startup that sells food products in order for management to investigate user behavior for the company's app. The designers would like to change the fonts for the entire app, but the managers are afraid the users might find the new design intimidating. They decide to make a decision based on the results of an A/A/B test. The users are split into three groups: two control groups get the old fonts and one test group gets the new ones.
